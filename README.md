An AI to classify whether it's a car or not.

This repository contains a Python script for predicting whether an image represents a car or not using the fastai library. The fastai library is a high-level deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch, which simplifies the process of training and deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models.
